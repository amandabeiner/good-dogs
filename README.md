# Good Dogs

A live-coded clinic to teach the basics of feature testing with Capybara on a Sinatra application. You should follow the tests and let them guide the building of your application. All data is stored in `dogs.csv`

## Setup
To get set up, run the following

```no-highlight
  bundle install
  ruby server.rb
```
and navigate to `localhost:4567`

Run `rspec` in a separate terminal tab to run your tests. Feel free to add `--fail-fast` to the `.rspec` file to see one test at a time.
